# Robo-advisor

SEIT - Mini Project PBL 


A typical Robo-advisor functions with the mechanism where it first collects data and relevant information from the users/clients about their financial situation, status, future goals, etc. through a sort of survey and then puts to use this collected data to offer advice and invests in client assets. So, indirectly Robo-advisors are automated investment solutions providing users with various digital tools featuring advanced customer experience, to guide them through a self-assessment process followed by investment behavior choices based on that.
In this project, the implemented Robo-Advisor works upon the data consumed by its users- via questionnaire - recording the clientâ€™s financial status, targeted expected returns, risk appetite, and financial goals.
